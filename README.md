# ðŸ§  Build GPT-Like Language Model

This repository contains the full code and workflow to **build, pretrain, and fine-tune a GPT-like Large Language Model (LLM)** following the principles and guidance from the book _"Build a Large Language Model"_.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights

- âœ… Implemented a GPT-like model architecture from scratch.
- âœ… Pretrained the model on a small unlabeled dataset.
- âœ… Loaded and integrated pretrained GPT weights from open-source releases.
- âœ… Fine-tuned the model for a binary classification task (SMS Spam Detection).
- âœ… Fine-tuned the model for instruction-based tasks.
